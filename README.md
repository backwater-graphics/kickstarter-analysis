# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
*In the data it can be determined that failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. 
 * It is also noted that the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. In other words, if the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects.
